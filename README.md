## Brief Overview
This project is a **Full Stack Employee Management System** where the back-end exposes RESTful APIs built using **Spring Boot and MySQL**, and the front-end is implemented using **React**.

The APIs were tested using **Postman** and later integrated into the React application using **Axios**.  
The system supports complete **CRUD operations** for employee data management.

This repository contains only the **front-end module**, which serves as the user interface and displays employee information retrieved from the back-end services.

The application allows users to:
- View employee records  
- Add new employees  
- Update existing employee details  
- Remove employees from the system  

This project is currently being used by a **local community sports club** to manage member records.

## 🎯 Purpose and Motivation
The main aim of this project was to design and implement a **fully functional end-to-end Full Stack application** using modern technologies.

With a strong interest in improving my full stack development skills, I worked on this project during my personal time to gain practical experience in API development, front-end integration, and database handling.
